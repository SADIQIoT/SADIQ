# SADIQ

SADIQ is an SDN-based system for providing IoT applications with dynamic location aware and context driven QoS. SADIQ is built on top of the floodlight controller and can be run on switches that support OpenFlow 1.3. We include in this repo in addtion to the SADIQ contoller modules, real data traces from two IoT application: weather signal and melbourne smart parking, and end server simulation of these two applications. We also include some useful scripts to regenrate the sensor traces and to evalaute the results.
